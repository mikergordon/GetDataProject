This is a code book for the wearables project.

Five steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. - using rbind

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. - using grep

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. - using names

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. - using names

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. - using ddply

The results are then written to a txt file


Variables:
dtActivities - activities
dtFeatures - features
dtFeaturesSub - subset of features
dtMaster - combined numerical data with subjects and activities
dtMerged - combined test and train data
dtMergedLabels - activities for merged set
dtMergedSub - subset of merged data with only mean and std
dtMergedSubject - merged data subjects
dtSummary - summary statistics of master data
dtTest - test data
dtTestLabels - test activities
dtTestSubject - test subjects
dtTrain - train data
dtTrainLabels - train activities
dtTrainSubject - train subjects
l - # of columns in master data set minus 2 (subject and activity)
